      "part1": "After working as a mailman for 15 years, I decided to change paths and pursue a career in technology. I've always had a passion for computers, ever since I got my first one as a teenager. That passion evolved over the years into a strong interest in understanding how systems work. These days, I enjoy tinkering with my home server, hosting various self-managed services, and experimenting with new technologies to broaden my understanding.",
      "part2": "Most of my skills are self-taught through consistent practice and personal projects. I believe in challenging myself to learn and grow, whether it's by building REST APIs or optimizing backend performance. These projects are not just a way for me to improve technically but also to develop a deeper understanding of the development lifecycle as a whole. My curiosity and determination to improve drive me to keep exploring and refining my craft.",
      "part3": "I attended Nackademin, where I studied backend development with a focus on Java and Spring Boot. The program was demanding, but I embraced the challenge and graduated with full scores. During my studies, I built several projects and gained hands-on experience with modern technologies and agile methodologies.

      "part4": "Beyond coding, I like to stay active and take time away from the screen to balance my focus. I often explore new technologies for fun, keep up with the latest trends in the tech world, or go for walks to clear my head. I enjoy being outdoors, which helps me recharge and return to projects with fresh energy and perspective."
